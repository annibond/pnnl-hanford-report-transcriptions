_Given source information for effluents from energy development and utilization, atmospheric transport research provides the necessary tools to describe pollutant behavior in the atmosphere. This behavior includes the action of the atmosphere to modify and distribute pollutants on local, regional, and global scales. It also includes the action of pollutants to alter atmosheric properties and transprot mechanisms. Ultimately, the atmosphere delivers pollutants to man and to ecosystems where their effects must be determined. To assure an adequate understanding of pollutant behavior in the atmosphere and its delivery to biological systems, the following atmospheric transport research is being conducted._

* Surverys of effluents released to the atmosphere

* Air flow and dispersion behavior of pollutants

* The dispostion and resuspension of contaminants

* The removal of the pollutants by scavenging in clouds and rain

* Physical and chemical transformations of pollutants, as they occur during transport

* Integration of models of pollutants dispersion, transformation, and removal processes

* effects on weather and climate.

These atmospheric processes are now primarily being investigated within the context of problems linked to the development and utilization of problems linked to the development and utilization of two energy resources: coal and nuclear energy. We plan future investigations of atmospheric problems caused by development of oil shale technology.

== Coal Combustion

The behavior of air pollution, involving the physical and chemical transformations that occur during transport and the removal of pollutants by wet and dry scavenging processes, is being defined in connection with expanding coal combustion for power production in the northeast United States. One of the most pressing problems from coal utilization is the release of large quantities of sulfur dioxide to the atmosphere, its transformation to sulfates, and its removal and ultimate delivery to biological systems where serious health and environment consequences can result. The greatest emphasis in atmospheric transport studies will be placed in the future, on this area of fossil fuel polutant transformation and removal. We anticipate additional reorientation of research previously focused on nuclear problems. This expanded non-nuclear research will be conducted in the Multi-State Atmospheric Power Production Pollution Studies (MAP3S).

== Nuclear Energy

The concern for long-lived particulates released to the environment from LMFBR operations dictates that research on particle deposition and resuspension processes be conducted in the context of nuclear power production problems. The primary hazard from plutonium is through inhalation; therefore its residence in the atmosphere must be clearly defined. Thus, removal of particulates from the atmosphere by deposition processes (which limits initial exposure) and any future resuspension from the surface presents (a continuing potential for inhalation hazards) are being evaluated. Research is also being done on waste heat inputs to the atmosphere from cooling towers. Proposed nuclear power parks will concentrate such releases of heat and moisture, representing energy densities comparable to those of severe storms and suggesting potential weather modifications. Thus, a significant fraction of the atmospheric transport program must remain associated with nuclear problems.

== Oil Shale

In the future, the significant atmospheric processes connected with another developing energy technology - shale oil production - will be investigated. The general need to understand air flow and dispersion in complex terrain especially important throughout the western United States, will be approached in connection with oil shale developments in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. Recent efforts to accelerate the development of synthetic fuels have increased the need for an interdisplinary evaluation of the health and environmental probloems associated with oil shale mining and retorting. PNL plans to undertake this evacuation. The mountainous oil shale region represents a particularly difficult air pollution problem; air is trapped in valleys for extended periods under certain meteorological conditions, and thus especially stringent siting requirements must be fulfilled to meet State and Federal air quality standards. Adequate models are not available for the complex air flow and dispersion conditions of the area; they must be developed to assure acceptable siting.
