The atmospheric concentration of radionuclides in surface air is measured continuously at Richland, Washington and Point, Barrow, Alaska by filtering large volumes of air through IPC filters, followed by gamma ray spectrometric analysis and chemical analysis for certain selected radionuclides. The spectrum of isotopes consists of natural radionuclides and their daughter products; from fission products, fissile material, activation products associated with nuclear weapons testing, and cosmogenic spallation reactions. The The radionuclide concentrations from weapons testing measured in 1975 were attributed essentially to two nuclear tests by the Republic of China. In June 1973 and again in June 1974 the Chinese tested nuclear devices of 2 - 3 MT and 1 MT respectively, inserting relatively large amounts of radioactive debris into the stratosphere. Previous data have shown that radioactive debris inserted into the stratosphere has a residence half-time of about 11 months. During the early part of each year approximately half of the stratospheric inventory is released into the upper troposphere and will be measured in surface air throughout the year. Debris inserted into the stratosphere during one year will not be measured in surface air until the following year.

The fission product concentrations in surface air at Point Barrow and Richland during 1975 of radionuclides with half-lives greater than one year varied from equal to half the value measured in 1974, respectively (*Figures 1 and 2*). This is about what would be postulated, since the stratospheric inventory in early 1974 consisted of debris from the 3 MT device tested in June 1973 and about 0.8 MT of debris left over from the 1969 and 1970 nuclear tests. The total stratospheric inventory in early 1975 consisted of 1.9 MT residual from previous tests plus the 1.0 MT from the June 1974 test giving an inventory of 2.9 MT.

In the 1973 and 1974 nuclear tests significant amounts of activation products were created and inserted into the stratosphere. The concentration of ^54^Mn, ^57^Co, ^58^Co, ^60^Co, ^65^Zn, and ^88^Y in surface air at Richland and Point Parrow was increased in a manner similar to the fission products. The atmospheric concentrations of the cosmogenic radionuclides ^7^Be and ^22^Na have been measured since 1964. Sodium-22 was produced in significant quantities during the testing in 1961-1962. However, by 1967 the concentration in surface air was due entirely to spallation reactions, as was essentially all the ^7^Be since 1964. Monthly averages of atmospheric ^7^Be from 1964-1975 and ^22^Na from 1967-1975 are shown in *Figure 3*. The production rates of ^7^Be and ^22^Na are much higher in the lower stratosphere than near ground level; consequently, these isotopes show seasonal variations typical of radionuclides of stratospheric origin. Peak concentrations occur during May, June, and July at Richland, while at Point Barrow the peak concentrations are during March and April. Average peak concentrations at Point Barrow are always lower than those at Richland. This is possibly due to the transport of radionuclides from the stratosphere near the midlatitude in the region of the tropopause continuity.
