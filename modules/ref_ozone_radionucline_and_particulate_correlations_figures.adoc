image::../images/ref_ozone_radionucline_and_particulate_correlations_figure-1.png[A line graph that shows the daily changes of the ozone gas present. The x axis = time (hr) of the day. It shows increments of (1) 00:00, (2) 04:00, (3) 08:00, (4) 12:00, (5) 16:00, (6) 20:00, and (7) 24:00. There are two y axes present. The first y axis = a solid line (⎯⎯⎯) that tracks the nuclei/cm^3^. It shows increments of (1) 10^0^, (2) 10^1^, (3) 10^2^, (4) 10^3^, (5) 10^4^, and (6) 10^5^. The second y axis = a broken line (- - -) that tracks ozone concentration (ppb). It shows increments of (1) 0, (2) 10, (3) 20, (4) 30, and (5) 40. Finally, there are dotted lines within the bars that track the daily resultant speed.]

The x axis = each day of the month for all the graphs showing 1 - 31 in increments of one. (1) The first graph shows the surface wind speed and direction.  The y axis = mph in increments of (1) 0, (2) 10, (3), (20), 4 (30), 5 (40), and (6) 50. The y axis also shows the wind speed in directional lines. (2) The second shows the no/cm^-3^ with increments of (1) 10^1^, (2) 10^2^, (3) 10^3^, (4) 10^4^, (5) 10^5^, and (6) 10^6^. (3) The third graph shows the hourly precipitation in the air. The y axis = 1 inches per hour in increments of -0.1 - 0.4. The negative value denotes trace. (4) The fourth graph shows the ozone concentration (ppb) from 0 - 60 in increments of 10 for the element 0~3~. (5) The fifth graph shows the decay per minute (dpm) over kscm for the element ^7^Be. (6) The sixth graph shows the dpm over kscm from 0 - 300 in increments of 50 for the element ^144^Ce. (7) The last graph shows the dpm over kscm between 0 - 30 in increments of 50 for the element ^95^Nb.]
