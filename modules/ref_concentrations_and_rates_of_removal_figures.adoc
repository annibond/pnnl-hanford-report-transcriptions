.Typical Dinural Variation of Condensation Nuclei and Ozone Concentrations in Response to Atmospheric Stability Changes Near Ground Level
image::../images/ref_concentrations_and_rates_of_removal_figure-1.png[A line graph which displays nuclei and ozone concentrations were tracked during the day. The x axis = time (hr) for the hour of day. It shows increments of (1) 00:00, (2) 04:00, (3) 08:00, (4) 12:00, (5) 16:00, (6) 20:00, and (7) 24:00. There are two y axis, one for each side of the graph. The y axis displaying a solid line = nuclei/cm^3^ in increments of (1) 10^0^, (2) 10^1^, (3) 10^2^, (4) 10^3^, (5) 10^4^, and (6) 10^5^. The y axis displaying a dotted line = ozone concentration (ppb) in increments of (1) 0, (2) 10, (3) 20, (4) 30, (5) 40, and (6) 50.]

.Surface Wind Speed and Direction
image::../images/ref_concentrations_and_rates_of_removal_figure-2.png[A bar graph which displays the wind speed in mph, with the directions of the wind speed towards the top. The lines for wind direction illustrate the direction rather than use direction names or modifiers. The x axix = ???. It shows increments starting at 0 and ending at 31 that increase successively by integer integers. The y axis = miles per hour. It shows increments of (1) 0, (2) 10, (3) 20, (4) 30, (5) 40, and (6) 50.]
