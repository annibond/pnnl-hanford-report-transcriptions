|reaction in which the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of a single reactant

|FP
|f-factor in physics, a conversion between radiation exposure (roengens) to the absorbed dose (rads)

|Geiger-Müller
|portable instrument used to detect and measure ionizing radiation, also known as "Geiger counter"

|geostrophic
|the balance between the coriolis force and the horizontal pressure force in the atmosphere

|has a higher atomic number than uranium (92)

|σ
|lowercase sigma (Greek), standard deviation

|∑
|uppercase sigma (Greek); sum
