|electrical field strength (E/Q)
|a physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles such as electrons

|first order kinetics
|reaction in which the rate is directly proportional to the concentration of a single reactant

|fission
|the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, such as that of uranium or plutonium, into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy

|inversion layer
|where a layer of warm air is situated above cooler air in the atmosphere

|IPC filter
|air filter made by IPC Eagle (a brand of Idrobase Group)

|isoplething
|plotting a map which connects points of equal value for a specific variable, specifically atmospheric dispersion in this case

|isotope
|two or more forms of the same element with equal numbers of protons each but varying numbers of electrons

|synthesized benzofuran compounds, dpm/kscm = disentegrations per 1000 standard cubic meters (dpm/kscm)

|Lagrangian
|tracks the motion of individual particles, measuring their position, velocity, and acceleration overtime by following them through a fluid

|denotes an average value, a mean, or specific variable in a given model

|σθū
|covariance between the variable θ and a defined variable _u_

|μm
|unit of measurement of length, equal to one millionth of a meter (micrometer)
