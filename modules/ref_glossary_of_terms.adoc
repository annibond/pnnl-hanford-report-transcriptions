|assay
|investigative procedure to measure a specific substance or compound

|Avogadro's number
|6.022x10^23^

|CIE/Q
|relevant data points include nucleus, nuclear energy, nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, and nuclear radiation

|crosswind
|wind blowing in a direction not parallel to a course

|eddy energy
|kinetic energy associated with the swirling, turbulent motions a fluid (e.g., ocean, air)

|E/Q
|electric field strength

|FP
|f-factor in physics, a conversion between radiation exposure (roengens) to the absorbed dose (rads)

|Geiger-Müller
|portable instrument used to detect and measure ionizing radiation, also known as "Geiger counter"

|inert
|unmoving, stopped

|isoplething
|plotting a map which connects points of equal value for a specific variable, specifically atmospheric dispersion in this case

|unit of measurement for absorbed dose of ionizing radiation, corresponding to the absorbption of 0.01 Joule/kg

|roentgens
|legacy (inactive) unit of measurement for x-rays and gamma rays

|scm
|standard cubic meter, a unit of volume for a gas measured under standard conditions of temperature and pressure

|Sf
|spontaneous fission

|tracer
|substances added into a system which can be used to track movement and behavior of physical, chemical, or biological processes

|transuranic
|has a higher atomic number than uranium (92)

|σ
|lowercase sigma (Greek), standard deviation

|∑
|uppercase sigma (Greek); sum

|θ
|lowercase theta (Greek)

|ū
|denotes an average value, a mean, or specific variable in a given model

|σθū
|covariance between the variable θ and a defined variable _u_

|μm
|unit of measurement of length, equal to one millionth of a meter (micrometer)
