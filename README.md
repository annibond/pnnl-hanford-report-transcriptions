**About this project**

This repository exists for a few reasons:

1. My grandfather, C. L. Simpson, was a meteorologist for the Hanford Nuclear Reservation and the Pacific Northwest Laboratories during World War II and the Cold War in Richland, WA. He was born in 1927 and given to a (Depression-era) orphanage. I don't know when he moved to Washington. He was 60 years old when I was born, and he died in the early 2000s when I was in the seventh grade, and I miss him. I read the work to be close to him again.

2. In the "current era" of the United States on the road to fascism and the potential withdrawal from NATO, Hanford's history with nuclear weapons testing isn't just part of our history; it's part of our present.

3. I am a technical writer in "cutting edge" technology in software development including cybersecurity, automation, and open source. Partially, I feel connected to a man who also worked in cutting edge technology in the nuclear era and wrote technical reports about it. However banal though, I want to keep current on written documentation.

**Why should YOU give a shit?**

If the United States pulls out of NATO, we resume nuclear war tensions with conflicting nations, and so many more of them than before have nukes of their own. This history is our history but hopefully not our future. The cultural impact of World War II and the nuclear arms race is significant enough that my generation - despite not being raised with the drills of my cousins' and father's generations - shouldn't forget it. It's still within living memory.

Also Research Gate tried to charge me $300 per article when the PDF copies displayed they should be freely distributed. They're morally bankrupt, and I'm petty. So here we are, I guess.

**I don't recognize any of those names or places**

Hanford was critical to the success of the United States in World War II and a part of The Manhattan Project, the project through which nuclear arms research was conducted during the war. The research continued after the end of that war through the Cold War. That research included the infamous Green Run experiment. While fascinating in a "wow, that's messed up" kind of way, that's not within the scope of my project. The same is true for the pollution of the Columbia River and everyone downwind's extra cancer risk (including mine).

**Let's get "The Simpson's" jokes out of the way**

My name is Anni Simpson, and I was born in Pasco, WA in 1987. Because it's been the source of jokes _my entire life anyway_, that does mean:

1. I was born in the Pacific Northwest like Matt Groening. He is from Oregon, but the same river Hanford used to cool its reactors - the Columbia River - linked both states.

2. I was born the year "The Simpson's" aired on "The Tracy Ulman Show". The show premiered in May, making it seven months older than me. The full series premiered in 1989. Because of our name, I was allowed to watch it as a kid, which was unthinkable in the 1990's. Bart is not a horrible little boy who's like a little Satan in disguise, but you wouldn't know that by the way he was discussed _then_. Stewie Griffin doesn't get dragged the way Bart ever did.

3. If you remember older epsisodes like "Bart the Daredevil" (S02E08) and "El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer" (S08E09), as well as newer episodes like "On a Clear Day, I Can't See My Sister" (S16E12), "Mona Leaves-a" (S19E19), and "Fland Canyon" (S27E19), there's clear recognition of a side desert somewhere in the near proximity of Springfield, which is roughly equivalent to Eastern Washington's climate.

4. I was raised in the 1990's, the culture of the men in Dad's generation included crummy tasting (imo) beer, and I am approximately as much older to my little brother as Lisa is to Maggie.

5. My father and grandfather worked at Hanford - a nuclear plant - which had massive safety concerns and violations that are ongoing including being the "most toxic place in the Western *hemisphere*" due to the pollution of the Columbia River. That would sorta put it on the same level as Springfield per "The Simpson's Movie", ironically the last movie we saw as a family unit of the four of us.

If you make a joke about it to me, there's a good chance I'll find it funny.
