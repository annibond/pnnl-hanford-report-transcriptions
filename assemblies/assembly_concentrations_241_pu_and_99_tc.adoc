= The Concentrations ^241^Pu and ^99^Tc in Surface Air at Richland, Washington

C. W. Thomas

Concentrations of ^241^Pu and ^99^Tc build up in nuclear wastes from power production reactors. Therefore, the concentrations of. ^241^Pu and ^99^Tc were measured in air samples collected at Richland, Washington in previous years to provide a baseline against which future concentrations can be compared. Plutonium-241 is of interest because it is a precursor to ^241^Am, which is as toxic via the human food chain as ^239-240^Pu. The reactions of Tc are similar to those of I in the human body; Tc, like I, is concentrated in the thyroid.
