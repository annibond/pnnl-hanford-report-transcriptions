= Atmospheric Fallout During 1975 at Richland, Washington and Point Barrow, Alaska

C. W. Thomas

The atmospheric radionuclide concentrations in surface air are monitored continuously at Richland, Washington and Point Barrow, Alaska. The radionuclides in the atmosphere at these locations in 1975 resulted primarily from a 2 - 3 MT Chinese test in June 1973 and a 1 MT Chinese test in June 1974. The concentrations in 1975 of radionuclides with half-lives greater than one year varied from Equal to one-half the concentrations measured in 1974.
